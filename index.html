I'm 24 years old and at the moment I'm working at a bookstore, a literary journal, and a museum. I'm also working on a more personal project, an art blog called <a href="http://themostzine.com">The Most</a> </td>

              <td bgcolor="ffffff" width="600" border="0">While setting up my first wordpress blog, I realized that I wanted to take things further and better understand the mechanics of what I was actually doing. At that point I had heard of PHP but wasn't exactly sure how to implement it. I feel like this class is a great way for me to get my hands dirty with a few new languages and a better understanding of the server side of things.
