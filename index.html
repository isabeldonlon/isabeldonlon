       			<p> I hope that this page gives you a decent overview of my skills and aesthetics, as well as a brief introduction to who I am. I'm 24 years old and at the moment I'm working at a bookstore, a literary journal, and a museum. I'm also working on a more personal project, an art blog called <a href="http://themostzine.com">The Most</a></p>
